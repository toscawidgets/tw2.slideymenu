tw2.slideymenu is a `toscawidgets2 (tw2)`_ package with `slidey` menu that I
made just for you!

Live Demo
---------

Slideymenu is best demonstrated by its use in `narcissus
<http://narcissus.rc.rit.edu>`_.  Definitely check it out.

You can also see it in the `tw2 WidgetBrowser
<http://tw2-demos.threebean.org/module?module=tw2.slideymenu>`_ although it doesn't
do it justice.

Description
-----------

`toscawidgets2 (tw2)`_ aims to be a practical and useful widgets framework
that helps people build interactive websites with compelling features, faster
and easier. Widgets are re-usable web components that can include a template,
server-side code and JavaScripts/CSS resources. The library aims to be:
flexible, reliable, documented, performant, and as simple as possible.

This package contains a menu that slides!
